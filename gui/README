A simple ticker-style display of keylogger data.

Set up a manage hook in XMonad to display the window.

   import XMonad.Hooks.ManageHelpers (doRectFloat)

   myManageHooks :: ManageHook
   myManageHooks = composeAll [ className =? "Keyloggui" --> doKeyloggui ]
       where
          doKeyloggui = doRectFloat $ RationalRect 0.4 0.98 0.2 0.02

Run the collector into the gui with a pipe:
  $ mkfifo key_stream
  # keylog > key_stream
  $ keyloggui < key_stream


TODO:
  - make window boring
  - make window appear on all workspaces
  - bundle all XMonad config into a module
  - if you suspend collector with C-z, mouse to another window, then mouse back
    and resume, it thinks C- is active until you hit ctrl key again.
  - need way to disable collection during password entry, etc.
