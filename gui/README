A simple ticker-style display of keylogger data.

Set up a manage hook in XMonad to ignore the window.

   keylogManageHook :: ManageHook
   keylogManageHook = className =? "Keyloggui" --> doIgnore

Run the collector into the gui with a pipe:
  $ sudo keylog | keyloggui

The sudo password prompt will likely be piped into the gui and
disappear, leaving a blank, unresponsive gui window. Either run
a sudo command in the shell first so the password is cached, or
just type the password blind and the gui display will start showing
output.
